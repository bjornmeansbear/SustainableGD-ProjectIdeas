# Some Notes and Thoughts.

## What to do?
- ask everyone to send syllabi/project ideas to share?
- where/how? google drive? basic webpage? git repo? contact form to collect more submissions? (yeah, this is important, what is the best way to collect stuff... how to make it easy?)
- Share recording of initial zoom call w/ those on initial list that couldn't make it
- do we need to capture more people yet? just start with the 12 or 14 or so we have?
- Saturate design educators with sustainability/climate stuff: https://teachingresource.aiga.org/
- Piggyback on existing things wherever possible?
- get back in touch with N re: DEC related ideas

## Other:
